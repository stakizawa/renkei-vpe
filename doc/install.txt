* Tips
** Change the number of replicas of images stored in gfarm
Basically, just editing $RVPE_LOCATION/etc/rvped.conf is OK.

  $ vi $RVPE_LOCATION/etc/rvped.conf
      gfarm_replica_count: 3

  However, Renkei-VPE creates image replicas periodically and does not create
any on when images are stored in gfarm. There is an option to create replicas
on a call of 'rvpeimage import'.

  To create image replicas on its import time, edit /etc/init.d/rvpe.

  $ vi /etc/init.d/rvpe
      N_REPLICAS=2

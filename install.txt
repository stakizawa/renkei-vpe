* Tips
** Change the number of replicas of images stored in gfarm
1. edit rvpe to change number of replicas created on time when images are
   registared by rvpeimage.

     $ vi /etc/init.d/rvpe
         N_REPLICAS=2

2. edit tm_gfarmrc to change number of replicas created on time when images
   are copied from running VMs (by rvpevm mark_save & shutdown).

     $ vi $ONE_LOCATION/etc/tm_gfarm/tm_gfarmrc
         N_REPLICAS=2
